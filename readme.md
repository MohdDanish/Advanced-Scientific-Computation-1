# Self-study

Currently going through public materials of AM 207.  The materials and solutions utilize iPython notebook.

I highly recommend installing Anaconda to manage python-related materials.  

For Mac users, you can download by:

1.  Going to conda.io
2.  Or by running this script in you Mac OS terminal:

`bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
